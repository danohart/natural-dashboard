This is a project based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that gets WooCommerce report data from your self-hosted WordPress website.

## Getting Started

Create a .env file in the root directory, add variables for ...

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_CK
NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_CS
NEXT_PUBLIC_WP_URL
```

... with your WooCommerce keys and your WordPress URL, then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
